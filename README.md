### Yobit on a "go slow" ###

MAO was submitted to the 4 -7 business days, 0.10 BTC Premium [sic] Addcoin on the 16th June, and has been resubmitted several times after that. About five or 6 support tickts have been submitted. None of these has had a response. My 0.10 BTC Yobi Code has also not been used.

Yobit can take more than a month to get around to adding a coin, so more like 21 - 30 business days.

MAO is still difficult to mine, and when I try, when the difficulty is below 100, it soon shoots up, leaving me stranded and unable to match the GHz being thrown at it.

So somebody wants to collect it

The hybrid period finishes at 14000 blocks, and there will probaby be about 5.5 - 6 million total, then just 5% interest on staking wallets.

If you would like to hurry Yobit up, you can contact <a href="https://yobit.net/en/support/" target="_blank">support</a> or better, put a <a href="https://yobit.net/en/addcoin/" target="_blank">"free addcoin"</a> request in, and it might just make a difference.

### Road map ###

A new prediction is below:



**Revised Prediction of total coins in 12 weeks (full PoS):**

We are currently at 7,000 plus blocks, so staaked blocks have been quite prolific.

New prediction
